### Quick description of what this does!
#### The goal of this ""model"" is to see how well the existing neighborhoods in Eindhoven
#### fit the criteria for a 15-minute city. It specifically uses OpenStreetMap's OSMnx 
#### library, which allows us to epxloit the existing neighborhood classifications of 
#### Eindhoven, and see which ones best fit the specified criteria (which can easily be)
#### changed by changing tags.

#### Ideally, the next step would be to not hard-code this but provide input on tags for
#### the 15-minute city, but that's for later. For now I also added "loading" statements,
#### because it takes a while to load.


# Configure criteria to roughly fit 15mC as defined by Carlos Moreno
# (so access to amenities via 15 minute walk... + bike in our case)
place = "Eindhoven, Netherlands"

# According to the Journal of Applied Physiology, average walking speed falls 
# between 4.0 - 5.9 km/h. Here, we use the lower bound, since the model is supposed
# to be as inclusive as possible.
average_walk_speed = 4

# On Copenhagen's website it says that an elderly person averages a 10 km/h
# cycling speed. For the same reason as stated above, we use this as our average.
average_bike_speed = 10

# It's a 15-minute city, so:
time_min = 15

walk_radius_m = average_walk_speed * 1000 / 60 * time_min    
bike_radius_m = average_bike_speed * 1000 / 60 * time_min    


# The "amenities" are lifted straight from the lsit of services I (Maciej) found during research 
# for the first part of the assignment. OSMnx uses a pretty odd manner of defining "leisure," 
# but in
