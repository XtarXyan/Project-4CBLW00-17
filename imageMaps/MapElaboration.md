## Elaboration on Map usage
The maps you will find in this folder are split into two categories: 

- "District Maps" - maps which relate to the process of creating zones of operation for mobility hubs. This encompasses maps which define the regions within which the hubs will be placed, not those contianing the actual placements of the hubs.
- "Mobility Maps" - maps which relate to the placement of mobility hubs based on GeoJSON data; these maps are also visualized directly in their accompanying notebooks.
- "Simulation Maps" - maps which relate to the simulation process mentioned in Task 3 on Canvas, visualizing the mobility paths of simulated citizens of Eindhoven.

A majority of these maps are .HTML Folium maps, which allows for zooming and scrolling, which should be help the overall visibility of the findings.
