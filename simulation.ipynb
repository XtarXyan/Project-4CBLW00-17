    "- Each timestep t representing a day. We simulate for each Agent the course of one day\n",
    "- Each agent represents a person living at a specific residence in Eindhoven\n",
    "- Each agent has a list of amenity types that they visit regularly and a probability that they will visit it on any given day.\n",
    "- Each agent can either walk or cycle to work. They randomly choose whether they walk or cycle each day.\n",
    "- Some agents have a workplace. This can be one of the amenity types. They will always go to the same workplace with a high probability on each day.\n",
    "- For the amenities they donâ€™t work at, an agent keeps a list of the closest n amenities to their home or workplace, and go to one of those on the list based on a geometrically decreasing probability in order of proximity. We name this probability \"curiosity\"."
